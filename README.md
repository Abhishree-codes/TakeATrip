Project's Title: This is an HTML & CSS project with JavaScript. It is made from the tempelate that we were assigned and the goal was to imitate as much of the original desig as possible.

Project Description: The tempelate we were given was the landing page design of a travel ecommerce website. Based on that, we have tried to clone as much of the design as we could and implemented functionalities.

Functionalities implemented: -Register Page: Takes user data and stores it in local storage to be used. Doesn't allow same email to be registered. Implemented password requirements. Asks for OTP and verifies the OTP using random generator. Option to redirect to login.

-Login Pages: Check for correct details with the respect to LS and redirect to home page.

-Nav Bar has a drop down with the option to go to cart. Also has links to product page. 

-The Footer has the links to login, logout and admin login.

-Landing Page
Has the option to enter email and and shows pop up if email is not valid. Has dynamic images, which show the top 4 users with the most bookings.

Product Page Has sort and filter functionality as well as pagination. Clicking on product redirects to individual product page.
-Individual product page has add to cart functionality.

Cart Page shows saved cart for each user and has the option cancel a booking.

Checkout Page has a form to fill in the user details and shows the filled in form after completing the checkout.

Admin Page has all the user details and trip details with sort, filter and pagination functionality.

Functionalities we would like to implement in the future: 
-We couldn't make the entire site responsive, so in the future we would like to make all pages including the landing page responsive.
-Try an UI library for the landing page design instead of using vanilla js and css code as we think that might make the responsiveness easier to implement and more effective.
-Add more filters in the product page and make it more dynamic.
-Add more designing to individual product page and checkout page.
-Add a temporary cart functionality for anyone who's not logged in.
